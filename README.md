# babel-plugin-offside-js
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-plugin-offside-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-plugin-offside-js)

JSY is an indented (offside) JavaScript dialect. We believe indentation is better at describing code blocks.

This is the Babel 6.x + Babylon implementation.

Please see [JSY language docs](https://github.com/jsy-lang/jsy-lang-docs) for details on the JSY dialect.


## Deprecated

Please use [babel-plugin-jsy-lite](https://github.com/jsy-lang/babel-plugin-jsy-lite) instead.
